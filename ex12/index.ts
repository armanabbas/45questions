// Question 12: Greetings: Use the array from Exercise 11. Instead of just printing each person’s name, print a message to them. The message should be the same for each person, but personalized with their name.

let names = ["Saqib" , "Aqib" , "Arman" , "Babar" , "Qasim"];
for (let i = 0 ; i < names.length; i++ ) {
    console.log("my name is " + names[i]);
};
