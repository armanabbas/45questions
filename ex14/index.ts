// Question 14: Guest List: If you could invite anyone, living or deceased, to dinner, who would you invite? Make a list that includes at least three people you’d like to invite to dinner. Then use your list to print a message to each person, inviting them to dinner.

let guestList = ["Saqib" , "Aqib" , "Arman" , "Babar"];
for(let i=0; i<guestList.length; i++) {
    console.log(`Assalam o Alaikum ${guestList[i]} I wanna be invite you for dinner can you join me?`);
}
